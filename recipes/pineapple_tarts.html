    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and shredded</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 whole cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine all-purpose, self-rising flour and salt.
             Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well
              in the center of the mixture. Pour in 1 beaten egg and water. 
              Bind the ingredients together gently. Do not knead too much. 
              Shape dough into a ball, wrap in plastic and refrigerate 
              for 4 hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine pineapple and sugar.
             Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently,
              for 30 minutes, or until mixture thickens. Remove from heat
               and allow to cool.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch
             in thickness. Cut 24 rounds, using a 2 inch round fluted cutter.
              Place on cookie sheet. Put a spoonful of pineapple jam in the
               center of each piece. Decorate with criss-cross strips of 
               pastry over jam, extending slightly onto pastry shell.
        </li>
        <li>Cut 24 more 2 inch rounds, then, using a smaller cutter,
             cut out the centers, creating a ring shape. Moisten the edges
              of each pastry, and place the rings on top of each pastry shell.
               Brush the top of the pastry with beaten egg.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to cool on
             baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>
